# tip-calculator
A short program to calculate a bar tender's average tips and hourly wage.


I am relatively new to Ruby and was wondering if people more experienced than myself could look at this code and show me more
efficient ways of accomplishing the same task.  This program asks a user (assumed to be a bar tender or service industry worker)
to enter how much they make in tips per shift and then calculates their average tips.
